Lastly, an option to summarize your total progress wtih subjects and homework completed summarized into either a pie chart or bar graph.

## Installation
---
1. Open the folder, clone the repository, or download the code.
2. Ensure you have installed extensions such as python and code runner.
3. Ensure all files and folders from the branches are present, if not, please contact the team leader with the info below.

## Execution and Usage
---
Short Paragraph here maybe a bulletted list

+ Run the main file
+ Select the option to create subjects,
+ list item three

## Used Technologies
---
+ Pygame- It assists the time logs, by producing the study session window and times.
`pip install pygame` ,Update pygame, can update by inputting yes when requested.

 
+ Matplotlib - It summaries data and is introduces a feature that allows the user to view the data in graphs and charts such as a pie graph, or a bar chart.
`pip install matplotlib`, you can also update to get the latest version by inputting `python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip`, this is printed so the user can easily copy and paste it into their terminal. 

## Current Features
